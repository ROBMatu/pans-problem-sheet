### **helloworld.py**

This is a basic program that prints out the string 'Hello World!' to the user.

---

### **bank.py**
This program does the following: 

Prompts the user for name and then greets them.
Then two money amounts in cents are inputted by the user.
which are then added together and divided by 100 to a floating point number that could be formatted to represent euro.
The Sum is then formatted with a â‚¬ euro sign and decimal point and rounded to 2 decimal places after the point.

---

### **accounts.py**
This program contains two versions of the program that do the following:

**The first:**
A Bank 10 digit account number as string is inputted,
then all but the last 4 digits replaced with an x 

**The second:**
To deal with account numbers of any length. 
A for loop may be used to go through a substring minus the last 4 digits 
and replace each character of the substring with an x. 
Then join it with another another substring contaning the last 4 digits of the account number.
Comment out line 13,15,16,22  and then Uncomment line 12,18,19,20,23  for this version.

### **collatz.py**
This program does the following:

Asks for an input of a positive number. It then enters that number into the collatz calculations that, if Even divide by 2, Odd multiply by 3 and add 1. Then the collatz conjucture calculation results are printed out.

### **weekday.py**
This program does the following:

It uses the dattime module in order to output if today is a weekday or not. By getting the fullname of today and checking if its in a list of weekdays of Monday to Friday. Then outputting either "Yes, today is a weekday!" or "We are in the weekend!"
